    <h3>How to make No-Bake Chocolate Cheesecake step-by-step</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Gather all ingredients.</li></p>
        <p><li>Mix graham cracker crumbs with melted butter and 1 tablespoon of sugar; press crumb mixture into bottom and 1/2-inch up the sides of an 8-inch springform pan. Refrigerate crust while you make the filling.</li></p>
        <p><li>Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in the microwave on high power for 1 to 2 minutes, or until melted, stirring every 15 seconds; set aside to cool.</li></p>
        <p><li>Whisk cocoa powder and enough warm water together in a medium bowl to form a smooth paste.</li></p>
        <p><li>Beat cream cheese and remaining sugar into cocoa mixture until combined; set aside.</li></p>
        <p><li>Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold in cooled melted chocolate.</li></p>
        <p><li>Fold chocolate cream mixture into cream cheese mixture until thoroughly combined; spread on top of graham cracker crust.</li></p>
        <p><li>Freeze cheesecake for 1 hour. Thaw in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before serving.</li></p>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>Taste a little of the filling to ensure that the right amount of chocolaty goodness has been reached. You can add a little more of the cocoa powder and water mixture to taste.</p>
    <p>Instead of freezing, the cheesecake can also be covered and chilled at least 2 hours before serving.</p>
    <p>Cheesecake may be stored in an airtight container and chilled up to 5 days.</p>
